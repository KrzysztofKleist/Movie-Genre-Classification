# Movie Genre Classification

A repository for my Master's Thesis titled **Machine Learning & Cinema: Color grading style classificationthrough Vectorscopes and CNNs**.

The goal of this project was to find a connection between a movie frame and the genre of the movie it represents. I tested the hypothesis in two different modalities - raw frames and vectorscope representations of frames.

For that task, I implemented four Machine Learning models using PyTorch:
- AlexNet
- VGG-16
- ResNet-50
- Vision Transformer
